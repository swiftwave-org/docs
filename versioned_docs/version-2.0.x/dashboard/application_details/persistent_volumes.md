In **Persistent Volumes** section, you can see all the persistent volumes of the application. You can add new persistent volumes, edit existing persistent volumes, and also can delete persistent volumes.

You can choose pre-registered persistent volume and provide a mount path. After you change something, click on **`Apply Changes`** button to save the changes.

> **Mount Path** - The path where the persistent volume will be mounted inside the container of the application.

If you see the **Persistent Volume** select dropdown empty, that means you don't have any persistent volume registered. You can create a new persistent volume in that case by tapping on the **Create New Persistent Volume** button.
