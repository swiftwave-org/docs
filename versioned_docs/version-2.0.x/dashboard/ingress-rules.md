### ðŸ˜… Don't know what ingress rules are ?
In layman's terms, ingress rules are the rules that will connect your domain to your application.

For example, you have an web application (named **myapp**) running on port 3000 and you want people can access it via `https://myapp.com`. You can do that by creating an ingress rule that will connect your domain to your application.

```
myapp.com [https] -> myapp:3000
```

### Add Ingress Rule for Deployed Application
To add an ingress rule, click on **Add New** button. You will see a form like this:
![Add Ingress Rule](/assets/2.0.x/add-ingress-rule-application.png)

You can choose the protocol your application required.
- **HTTP**: You can choose any port for your application. It's recommended to use port 80 for HTTP.
- **HTTPS**: Currently, only port 443 is supported.
  > Note: To enable, **HTTPS Redirection**, you will have to create a redirect rule. You can follow [**this docs**](./redirect-rules#https-redirect) section to create a redirect rule.
- **TCP**: If your application relies on TCP protocol, you can choose this option. You can choose any port for your application.
  > NOTE : In case of TCP, You don't need any domain. You can directly connect your application to your server's IP and port (you choose).
- **UDP**: If your application relies on UDP protocol, you can choose this option. You can choose any port for your application.
  > NOTE : In case of UDP, You don't need any domain. You can directly connect your application to your server's IP and port (you choose).

Then, you can choose the domain you want to connect to your application. If you don't have any domain, you can click on `Register New Domain` to add a new domain.

**Finally**, you can choose the application you want to connect to your domain. 

Hurrah! You have successfully created an ingress rule. Now, you can access your application via your domain.
It takes upto 1 minute to apply the changes.

> **Note :** If you have created an ingress rule for port except 80 and 443, you will have to wait for 1~2 minutes to see the effect. This is because, we have to reload HAProxy or UDPProxy and other services to expose the port. You should open the port in your server's firewall too.


### Add Ingress Rule for External Application

You can use the integrated proxy in Swiftwave to expose certain applications to the outside world if you are unable to deploy them in swiftwave for some reason.

:::info

That external application should use this docker overlay network > `swiftwave_network`

:::

For that, click on **Add New** button. In the form, you will see a label `Need to expose some external services ?`. Click on it and you will see a form like this:

![Add Ingress Rule](/assets/2.0.x/add-ingress-rule-external.png)

From here, you can type the container / service name of that external application and create an ingress rule for it.

Hurrah!


### Delete Ingress Rule
To delete an ingress rule, click on **Delete** button. You will see a confirmation dialog. Confirm it and your ingress rule will be deleted.
