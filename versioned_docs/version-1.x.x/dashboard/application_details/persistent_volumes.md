You can choose pre-registered persistent volume and provide a mount path. After you change something, click on **`Apply Changes`** button to save the changes.

> **Mount Path** - The path where the persistent volume will be mounted inside the container of the application.

If you see the **Persistent Volume** select dropdown empty, that means you don't have any persistent volume registered. You can register a persistent volume by following [**this docs**](/docs/dashboard/persistent-volumes).
