### Register a new domain

### Delete a domain
You can click on `Delete` button to delete a domain.
> Note : You can only delete a domain if
> - it is not being used by any application
> - no ingress rules linked to it
> - no redirect rules linked to it

### Verify DNS
You can click on `Verify DNS` button to verify if domain is correctly pointing to the proxy server.

:::tip

- If you are using cloudflare as your DNS provider, it is recommended to use DNS only mode while mapping your domain to the proxy server IP.
- If you want to use Cloudflare Proxy Mode, go to `Domain SSL/TLS Mode` section and mark `Encryption Mode` to `Full`. After this, all your application hosted on swiftwave should use `https` protocol in all ingress rules.
