Let's get started with SwiftWave!
Let's first install SwiftWave on your server. Because without SwiftWave, you can't deploy your applications. ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ“¦ Pre-requisites
1. A Virtual Server with Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora OS or their derivatives installed.
2. Virtual Server should have at least 1GB RAM and 1vCPU.
3. Install curl, git, unzip and tar utilities.
    ```bash
    # For Debian/Ubuntu based distros:
    sudo apt update -y
    sudo apt install curl git unzip tar nfs-common -y

    # For Fedora based distros:
    sudo dnf install curl git unzip tar nfs-utils
    ```
4. Install docker (Skip this step if you already have docker installed)
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```
    > ðŸ“Œ Note: As RHEL doesn't support docker, SwiftWave doesn't support RHEL based distros.
5. You are all set! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“¥ Installation
1. SSH into your server.

2. Download SwiftWave binary
   - For **AMD64** Architecture
   ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwave/releases/download/1.0.5/swiftwave-1.0.5-linux-amd64.tar.gz -o swiftwave.tar.gz
   ```
   - For **ARM64** Architecture
   ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwave/releases/download/1.0.5/swiftwave-1.0.5-linux-arm64.tar.gz -o swiftwave.tar.gz
   ```
   - For **386** Architecture
   ```bash
    curl -L https://github.com/swiftwave-org/swiftwave/releases/download/1.0.5/swiftwave-1.0.5-linux-386.tar.gz -o swiftwave.tar.gz
   ```
3. Extract the gzip archive
    ```bash
    tar -xzf swiftwave.tar.gz
    ```
4. Make swiftwave binary executable
    ```bash
    chmod +x swiftwave
    ```
5. Move swiftwave binary to /usr/bin
    ```bash
    sudo mv swiftwave /usr/bin/swiftwave
    ```
6. ðŸ•’ Time for setup!
7. Initialize Docker Swarm
    ```bash
    sudo docker swarm init
    ```
8. Initialize SwiftWave configuration. Run following command and provide required information.
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave init
    ```
9. Prepare Environment for SwiftWave
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave setup
    ```
10. Run Local Postgres Database
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave postgres start
    ```
11. Migrate Database Tables
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave db-migrate
    ```
12. Generate SSL certificate for primary domain
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave tls generate-certificate
    ```
    :::tip
    If you are installing in a system which doesn't have any public ip, then you can skip this step and disable tls.

    Run the following command to disable tls.
    ```bash title="Disable TLS"
    sudo swiftwave tls disable
    ```
    :::
13. Start HAProxy Service
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave haproxy start
    ```
14. Start UDP Proxy Service
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave udpproxy start
    ```
15. Start SwiftWave Service
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave service enable
    ```
16. Enable auto updater for SwiftWave
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave auto-updater enable
    ```
17. Enable auto renew service for service TLS certificates
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave tls auto-renew enable
    ```
18. Create a new admin user
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave create-user --username <give_a_username> --password <give_a_strong_password>
    ```
19. ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! SwiftWave is now installed on your server. 
20. You can now access SwiftWave at `https://<your_domain>:3333`

:::info

You have forget or missed the auto-generated domain ðŸ˜… anyhow ? This is how you can get it back.
 - Suppose your server IP is `3.5.12.13`, then your domain will be `ip-3-5-12-13.swiftwave.xyz`
 - You have added a custom domain `example.com`, then you can use that domain to access it on https://example.com:3333.
 - Other way is open the config file by this command
    ```bash
    sudo swiftwave config -e vim
    ```
    and check the `service.address_of_current_node` field in the config file.
