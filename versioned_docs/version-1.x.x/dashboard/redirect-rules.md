### ðŸ˜… Don't know what redirect rules are ?
In layman's terms, redirect rules are the rules that will redirect your domain to another URL.

- Maybe you have a domain `github.portfolio.com` and you want to redirect it to your github profile `https://github.com/tanmoysrt`, you can do that by creating a redirect rule.
- Also, if you want to setup a HTTPS redirect, you can do that by creating a redirect rule, which will redirect all the HTTP requests from your domain to HTTPS one.

### Add Redirect Rule
It's very easy to add a redirect rule. Just click on **Add New** button and you will see a form like this:

1. Choose the protocol (http/https) and domain you want to redirect.
2. Choose the url where you want to redirect your domain.
3. Click on **Register** button and you are done.

### Delete Redirect Rule
To delete a redirect rule, click on **Delete** button. You will see a confirmation dialog. Confirm it and your redirect rule will be deleted.

### HTTPS Redirect
If you want to redirect all the HTTP requests from your domain to HTTPS one, you can do that by creating a redirect rule.
Suppose, you want to enable HTTPS redirect for `myapp.com`. You can do that by creating a redirect rule like this:
- **Domain**: `myapp.com`
- **Redirect URL**: `https://myapp.com`
