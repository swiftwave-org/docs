In **Domains** section, you can manage all the custom domains you have added to swiftwave.

![Domains List](/assets/2.2.x/domain-list.png)

### Register a new domain
You can click on `Register New` button and fill in the required details to register a new domain.

### Delete a domain
You can click on `Delete` button to delete a domain.
> Note : You can only delete a domain if
> - it is not being used by any application
> - no ingress rules linked to it
> - no redirect rules linked to it

### Verify DNS
You can click on `Verify DNS` button to verify if domain is correctly pointing to the proxy server.

:::tip

- If you are using cloudflare as your DNS provider, it is recommended to use DNS only mode while mapping your domain to the proxy server IP.
- If you want to use Cloudflare Proxy Mode, go to `Domain SSL/TLS Mode` section and mark `Encryption Mode` to `Full`. After this, all your application hosted on swiftwave should use `https` protocol in all ingress rules.

:::

**Note:** To use the `Verify DNS` feature, ensure that **Enable Ingress Proxy** is turned on for the server.

### Issue SSL Certificate 🛡️

You can issue a SSL certificate automatically via Let's Encrypt or by manually providing SSL certificate and private key.

- **Issue Automatically via Let's Encrypt**

  Swiftwave has Let's Encrypt integration. You can issue a SSL certificate for your domain by clicking on `Issue SSL` button.

  :::tip

  If you issue SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt, you don't need to worry about renewing your SSL certificate manually. Swiftwave will automatically renew your SSL certificate before it expires.

  :::

- **Add Custom SSL Certificate**

  - Click on `Issue SSL` button.
  - Choose `Custom SSL Certificate` option.

  - Now, provide your SSL certificate and private key in valid OpenSSL format.
    > **🤝 Need help to generate self-signed SSL certificate ?**
    > 
    > You can run following command to generate private key and self-signed certificate.
    > ```bash
    > openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes
    > ```
  - Submit and done !
  - It will take few minutes to apply the changes.

    :::warning

    You should only use this option 
    - if you can't open your server's port 80 and 443 to the internet due to security reasons. 
    - Also, you may have purchased SSL certificate from a third party and you want to use it.
    - If you just want to use self-signed certificate, you can go with this option.
